Cosmic Rays
===========

This module provides a data container for cosmic ray observables and can be used
to simply share, save and load data. Also visualization of the observables can
be done in a modular manner. There are two classes:

* Cosmic rays: Basic data container for cosmic rays
* Cosmic rays set: Provides a set of cosmic rays for simulation purposes
