Simulations
===========

The simulation module is a tool to setup arrival simulations in a few lines of
code. It is a wrapper for the core functions and is based on the data container
provided by the cosmic_rays module. The simulation module is a parametrized
simulation based on healpy, a tool to pixelize the sphere into pixels with
equally solid angle (https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
For examples have a look at the tutorial!
